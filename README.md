# DNN Energy Efficiency Prediction Model

Introduction ðŸ“š

This repository contains a Python code that builds a machine learning model to predict energy efficiency. The code first loads the data set from UCI, which contains data on the energy efficiency of buildings. The code then cleans the data by removing any missing values and outliers. Next, the code splits the data into training and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance. The code then defines a neural network model with three layers. The model is trained using the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the test set. The code then plots the model's loss and accuracy curves. Finally, the code makes predictions on the test set and evaluates the model's performance.
