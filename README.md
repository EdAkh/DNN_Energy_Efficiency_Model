# DNN Energy Efficiency Prediction Model 

## Introduction ðŸ“š

This project is about using a deep neural network to predict the heating load and cooling load of buildings. The data set used is from UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/energy+efficiency#) and is based on a Ecotect simulation of twelve different building, by playing with eight parameters (Relative Compactness, Surface Area, Wall Area, Roof Area, Overall Height, Orientation, Glazing Area, Glazing Area Distribution) they obtained 768 different shapes of building which have two outcomes (Heating Load and Cooling Load).
 
## Objective ðŸŽ¯ 
The goal is to train a  deep neural network capable of predict the heating load and cooling load of buildings.
